<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Various approaches have been employed over many years to
distinguish human users of web sites from <a>robots</a>. While the
traditional <a>CAPTCHA</a> approach of asking the user to identify
obscured text in an image remains common, other approaches have
also emerged. These approaches generally require users to perform a
task believed to be possible for humans and difficult for robots,
but the nature of the task inherently excludes many people with
disabilities, resulting in an incorrect denial of service to these
users. Research findings also have indicated that many popular
CAPTCHA techniques are no longer particularly effective or secure
challenging providers to deploy alternative approaches to block
robots, yet support access for people with disabilities. This
document examines a number of solutions that allow systems to test
for human users, and the extent to which these solutions adequately
accommodate people with disabilities.</p>

<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Web sites with resources that are attractive to aggregators such
as sign-up web pages, travel and event ticket sites, web-based
email accounts, and social media portals have long taken measures
to ensure that they can offer their service to individual users
without exposing their data and content to <a>web robots</a>.</p>
<p>An early solution was the use of graphical representations of
text in registration or comment areas of the web site. The site
would attempt to verify that the user was in fact a human by
requiring the user to complete a task commonly referred to as a
Completely Automated Public <a>Turing Test</a>, or <a>CAPTCHA</a>.
The assumption was that humans would find this task easy, while
robots would find it nearly impossible to perform.</p>
<p>The CAPTCHA was <a href="CAPTCHA.net">initially developed by
researchers at Carnegie Mellon University</a> and has been
primarily associated with a technique whereby an individual had to
identify a distorted set of characters from a bit-mapped image,
then enter those characters into a form. However, in recent times
the types of CAPTCHA that appear on web sites and mobile apps have
changed significantly. As such, the term “CAPTCHA” is used in this
document to refer to all approaches which are specifically designed
to differentiate a human from a computer.</p>
<p>While online users broadly have reported finding traditional
CAPTCHAs frustrating to complete, it is generally assumed that a
CAPTCHA can be resolved within a few incorrect attempts. The point
of distinction for people with disabilities is that a CAPTCHA not
only separates computers from humans, but also often removes people
with disabilities from performing the requested procedure. For
example, asking users who are blind, visually impaired or dyslexic
to identify textual characters in a distorted graphic is asking
them to perform a task they are least able to accomplish.
Similarly, asking users who are deaf or hearing impaired to
identify and transcribe in writing the content of an audio CAPTCHA
is asking them to perform a task they’re least likely to
accomplish. Furthermore, traditional CAPTCHAs have generally
presumed that all web users can read a particular character set or
English-based words, thus making the test inaccessible to a large
number of web users worldwide.</p>
<p>While Accessibility best practices require, and <a>assistive
technologies</a> expect, substantive graphical images to be
authored with text equivalents, <a>alternative text</a> on CAPTCHA
images would clearly be self-defeating. Nevertheless, a CAPTCHA
without an accessible and usable alternative makes it impossible
for users with certain disabilities to create accounts, write
comments, or make purchases on such sites. In essence, such
CAPTCHAs fail to properly recognize users with disabilities as
human, obstructing their participation in contemporary society.
Such issues also extend to situational disabilities whereby a user
may not be able to effectively view a traditional CAPTCHA on a
mobile device due to the small screen size, or hear an audio-based
CAPTCHA in a noisy environment.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Effectiveness</h2>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that using a <a>CAPTCHA</a> as a
security solution is becoming increasingly ineffective. Current
CAPTCHA methods that rely primarily on traditional image-based
approaches or logic problems can be largely cracked using both
complex and simple computer algorithms. Research suggests that
approximately 20% of traditional CAPTCHAs can be broken using OCR
algorithms, for instance <cite>Machine learning and empathy: the
Civil Rights CAPTCHA</cite> [[civil-rights-CAPTCHA]] and <cite>A
computer vision attack on the ARTiFACIAL CAPTCHA</cite>
[[facial-CAPTCHA-attack]].</p>
<p class="ednote">It is unclear from the article titles in those
references that they relate to OCR, the subject of the
sentence.</p>
<p>In addition, pattern-matching algorithms in some instances can
achieve an even higher success rate of cracking CAPTCHAs , as
demonstrated in <cite>CAPTCHA Security: A Case Study</cite>
[[CAPTCHA-security]] and <cite>HMM-based Attacks on Google’s
reCAPTCHA with Continuous Visual and Audio Symbols</cite>
[[reCAPTCHA-attacks]]. While efforts are being made to strengthen
traditional CAPTCHA security, more robust security solutions risk
reducing the typical user’s ability to understand the CATPCHA that
needs to be resolved, e.g., <cite>Defeating line-noise CAPTCHAs
with multiple quadratic snakes</cite> [[defeat-line-noise]].
Furthermore, CAPTCHAs have been solved for good and ill through
crowd sourcing, with the solutions sometimes stored for reuse.</p>
<p>Therefore it is highly recommended that alternative security
methods, such as two-step or multi-device verification, are
considered in preference to traditional image-based CAPTCHA methods
for both security and accessibility reasons.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Stand-Alone Approaches</h2>
<p>There are many techniques available to web sites to discourage
or eliminate fraudulent activities such as inappropriate account
creation. Several of them may be as effective as the visual
verification technique while being more accessible to people with
disabilities. Others may be overlaid as an accommodation for the
purposes of accessibility. The following list highlights common
<a>CAPTCHA</a> types and their respective accessibility
implications.</p>
<section>
<h3>Traditional character-based CAPTCHA</h3>
<p>The traditional character-based <a>CAPTCHA</a>, as previously
discussed, is largely inaccessible and insecure. It focuses on the
presentation of letters or words presented in an image and designed
to be difficult for <a>robots</a> to identify. The user is then
asked to enter the CAPTCHA information into a form.</p>
<p>The use of a traditional CAPTCHA is particularly problematic for
people who are blind, as the <a>screen readers</a> they rely on to
use web content cannot process the image, thus preventing them from
uncovering the information required by the form. Because the
characters embedded in a CAPTCHA are often distorted or have other
characters in close proximity to each other in order to foil
technological solution by robots, they are also very difficult for
users with other visual disabilities. This common CAPTCHA technique
is also less reliably solved by users with cognitive and learning
disabilities, see <cite>The Effect of CAPTCHA on User Experience
among Users with and without Learning Disabilities</cite>
[[CAPTCHA-ld]]. Because they’re intentionally distorted to foil
robots, they also foil users who are more easily confused by
surrealistic images or who do not possess sufficiently acute vision
to “see” beyond the presented distortion and uncover the text the
site requires in order to proceed.</p>
<p>While some sites have begun providing CAPTCHAs utilizing
languages other than English, an assumption that all web users can
understand and reproduce English has predominated. Clearly, this is
not the case. Native and literate Arabic or Thai speakers, for
example, should not be assumed to possess a proficiency with the
ISO 8859-1 character set [[iso-8859-1]], let alone ready access to
a keyboard to facilitate their ready reproduction in the CAPTCHA's
form field—demonstrating an important barrier imposed by CAPTCHAs
based on written English and related language character sets; see
<cite>Effects of Text Rotation, String Length, and Letter Format on
Text-based CAPTCHA Robustness</cite> [[CAPTCHA-robustness]].</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Sound output</h3>
<p>To re-frame the problem, text is easy to manipulate, which is
good for <a>assistive technologies</a>, but just as good for
<a>robots</a>. One logical solution to this problem is to offer
another non-textual method of using the same content. To achieve
this, audio is played that contains a series of characters, words,
or phrases being read out which the user then needs to enter into a
form. As with visual <a>CAPTCHA</a> however, robots are also
capable of recognizing spoken content—as Amazon’s Alexa and
Android’s Google Assistant, among other spoken dialog systems, have
so ably demonstrated. Consequently, the characters, words, or
phrases the user is to uncover and transcribe in the form are also
distorted in an audio CAPTCHA and are usually played over a sonic
environment of obfuscating sounds.</p>
<p>The industry recognized this problem early. CNet reported in
<a href=
"https://web.archive.org/web/20030707210529/http://news.com.com/2100-1032-1022814.html">
<cite>Spam-bot tests flunk the blind</cite></a> [[newscom]] that
“Hotmail’s sound output, which is itself distorted to avoid the
same programmatic abuse, was unintelligible to all four test
subjects, all of whom had good hearing.”</p>
<p>If the sound output, which is itself distorted to avoid the same
programmatic abuse, can render the CAPTCHA difficult to hear; there
can also be confusion in understanding whether a number is to be
entered as a numerical value or as a word, e.g. ‘7’ or ‘seven’.
Often the audio CAPTCHA user will hear sounds which seem to be
words or numerical values that should be entered, but turn out to
be just background noise.</p>
<p>Sound is intrinsically temporal, but the import of this
unavoidable fact is too often under appreciated—perhaps because the
world we live in as seen through the eyes is also temporal. Unlike
the real world seen through the eyes however, the traditional
CAPTCHA is a still image that can be stared at until comprehension
dawns. Sound has no analog to the visual still image.</p>
<p>Whenever any portion of an audio CAPTCHA is not understood; at
least some part of the CAPTCHA must be replayed, usually several
times. Currently, few audio CAPTCHAs provide an easily invoked
replay feature, let alone a pause, rewind, and fast-forward
feature. Consequently, an entirely new audio CAPTCHA is often
played should any part of one audio CAPTCHA prove difficult to
understand.</p>
<p>Some audio CAPTCHA tacitly admit this failure by offering a link
allowing the user to Download the audio CAPTCHA, typically as a mp3
file. The implicit assumption is that the user will use a favorite
audio player—which does provide pause, play, rewind, and fast
forward capabilities—to play the audio CAPTCHA MP3 file again and
again until comprehension dawns, perhaps pausing and rewinding the
playback and perhaps writing down on the side the text destined for
the web form. Clearly this is very inconvenient and subject to web
site time outs. It also illustrates why simply providing an audio
CAPTCHA alternative to the traditional visual CAPTCHA does not
provide equivalent access to the user.</p>
<p>Furthermore, just as not all web users should be presumed
proficient with English in visual CAPTCHA, they should not be
presumed capable of understanding and transcribing aural English in
an audio CAPTCHA. Unfortunately, non English audio CAPTCHAs appear
to be very rare indeed.</p>
<p>Users who are deaf-blind, don’t have or use a sound card, find
themselves in noisy environments, or don’t have required sound
plugins properly configured and functioning, are thus also
prevented from proceeding. Furthermore, relatively few audio
CAPTCHAs properly support all the various browsers and operating
systems in use today. Similarly, users of browsers which do not
support easy direction of sound output to a particular audio
device, or to all available audio devices on the system, are also
hampered.</p>
<p>Although auditory forms of CAPTCHA that present distorted speech
create recognition difficulties for <a>screen reader</a> users, the
accuracy with which such users can complete the CAPTCHA tasks is
increased if the user interface is carefully designed to prevent
screen reader audio and CAPTCHA audio from being intermixed. This
can be achieved by implementing functions for controlling the audio
that do not require the user to move focus away from the text
response field; see <cite>Evaluating existing audio CAPTCHAs and an
interface optimized for non-visual use</cite> [[eval-audio]].</p>
<p>Experiments with a combined auditory and visual CAPTCHA
requiring users to identify well known objects by recognizing
either images or sounds, suggest that this technique is highly
usable by screen reader users. However, its security-related
properties remain to be explored, as mentioned in <cite>Towards a
universally usable human interaction proof: evaluation of task
completion strategies</cite> [[task-completion]].</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Logic puzzles</h3>
<p>The goal of visual verification is to separate human from
machine. One reasonable way to do this is to test for logic. Simple
mathematical or word puzzles, trivia, or similar logic tests may
raise the bar for <a>robots</a>, at least to the point where using
them is more attractive elsewhere.</p>
<p>Problems: Users with cognitive disabilities may still have
trouble. Answers may need to be handled flexibly, if they require
free-form text. A system would have to maintain a vast number of
questions, or shift them around programmatically, in order to keep
<a>spiders</a> from capturing them all for use by web robots. This
approach is also subject to defeat by human operators engaged in
crowd-sourcing activity on behalf of attackers.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Limited-use accounts</h3>
<p>Users of free accounts very rarely need full and immediate
access to a site’s resources. For example, users who are searching
for concert tickets may need to conduct only three searches a day,
and new email users may only need to send the same notification of
their new address to their friends. Sites may create policies that
limit the frequency of interaction explicitly (that is, by
disabling an account for the rest of the day) or implicitly (by
slowing the response times incrementally). Creating limits for new
users can be an effective means of making high-value sites
unattractive targets to <a>robots</a>.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to this approach include the need to perform
sufficient testing and data collection to determine useful limits
that will serve human users yet frustrate robots. It requires site
designers to look at statistics of normal and exceptional users,
and determine whether clear demarcation exists between them.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Non-interactive checks</h3>
<p>While <a>CAPTCHA</a> and other interactive approaches to
limiting the activities of <a>web robots</a> are sometimes
effective, they do make using a site more complex. This is often
unnecessary, as a large number of non-interactive mechanisms exist
to check for spam or other invalid content typically introduced by
robots.</p>
<p>This category contains two popular non-interactive approaches:
<a>spam filtering</a>, in which an automated tool evaluates the
<em>content</em> of a transaction, and <a>heuristic</a> checks,
which evaluate the <em>behavior</em> of the client.</p>
<section>
<h4>Spam filtering</h4>
<p>Applications that use <a>continuous authentication</a> and “hot
words” to flag spam content, or <a>Bayesian filtering</a> to detect
other patterns consistent with spam, are very popular, and quite
effective. While such risk analysis systems may experience false
negatives from time to time, properly-tuned systems can achieve
results comparable to a traditional visual <a>CAPTCHA</a>, while
also removing the added cognitive burden on the user and
eliminating access barriers.</p>
<p>Most major blogging software contains <a>spam filtering</a>
capabilities, or can be fitted with a plug-in for this
functionality. Many of these filters can automatically delete
messages that reach a certain spam threshold, and mark questionable
messages for manual moderation. More advanced systems can control
attacks based on posting frequency, filter content sent using the
<a href=
"https://movabletype.org/documentation/trackback/specification.html">
Trackback protocol</a>, and ban users by IP address range,
temporarily or permanently.</p>
</section>
<section>
<section>
<h3>Image and video</h3>
<section>
<h4>Visual comparison CAPTCHAs</h4>
<p>There are a number of new <a>CAPTCHA</a> techniques based on the
identification of still images. This can include requiring the user
to identify whether an image is a man or a woman, or whether an
image is human-shaped or avatar-shaped among other comparison
solutions, such as <cite>CAPTCHAStar! A novel CAPTCHA based on
interactive shape discovery</cite>, [[CAPTCHAstar]],
<cite>FaceCAPTCHA: a CAPTCHA that identifies the gender of face
images unrecognized by existing gender classifiers</cite>
[[faceCAPTCHA]], and <cite>Social and egocentric image
classification for scientific and privacy applications</cite>
[[social-classification]].</p>
<p>While alternative audio comparison CAPTCHAs could be provided
such as using similar or different sounds for comparison, the
reliance on visual comparison alone would make these techniques
difficult, if not impossible for people with vision-related
disabilities to use.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>3D CAPTCHA</h4>
<p>A 3D representation of letters and numbers can make it more
difficult for OCR software to identify them, in turn increasing the
security of the <a>CAPTCHA</a>, described in <cite>On the security
of text-based 3D CAPTCHAs</cite> [[3d-CAPTCHA-security]]. However,
this solution raises similar accessibility issues to traditional
CAPTCHAs.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Video Game CAPTCHA</h4>
<p>This process suggests the completion of a basic video game as a
<a>CAPTCHA</a>, like <cite>Game-based image semantic CAPTCHA on
handset devices</cite> [[game-CAPTCHA]]. The benefits include the
removal of language barriers, and multiple interface methods could
potentially make such a solution accessible. It would also have the
benefit of making CAPCHA solving an enjoyable process, reducing the
frustrations generally associated with traditional CAPTCHAs.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Heuristic Approaches</h2>
<p><a>Heuristics</a> are discoveries in a process that seem to
indicate a given result. It may be possible to detect the presence
of a robotic user based on the volume of data the user requests,
series of common pages visited, IP addresses, data entry methods,
or other signature data that can be collected.</p>
<p>Again, this requires a careful examination of site data. If
pattern-matching algorithms can’t find good heuristics, then this
is not a good solution. Also, polymorphism, or the creation of
changing footprints, is apt to result, if it hasn’t already, in
robots, just as polymorphic (“stealth”) viruses appeared to get
around virus checkers looking for known viral footprints.</p>
<p>Another heuristic approach identified in <a href=
"http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi05/tech/kandula/kandula_html/"><cite>
Botz-4-Sale: Surviving DDos Attacks that Mimic Flash
Crowds</cite></a> [[killbots]] involves the use of <a>CAPTCHA</a>
images, with a twist: how the user reacts to the test is as
important as whether or not it was solved. This system, which was
designed to thwart distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks,
bans automated attackers which make repeated attempts to retrieve a
certain page, while protecting against marking humans incorrectly
as automated traffic. When the server’s load drops below a certain
level, the CAPTCHA-based authentication process is removed
entirely.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Multi-Party Approaches</h2>
<h3>The Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
<p>An widely—used example of a heuristic approach is the <a href=
"https://www.google.com/reCAPTCHA/"><cite>Google
reCAPTCHA</cite></a> which features a check box labelled ‘I am not
a robot’ or similar phrasing. The process works by collecting data
such as mouse movement and keyboard navigation to determine whether
the user is human or robot, while keeping the CAPTCHA process
relatively simple.</p>
<p>For a time Google's reCAPTCHA V2 was regarded the most
accessible CAPTCHA solution for this very reason, capable of being
comfortably completed using a variety of <a>assistive
technologies</a>. More recently it has been widely observed that
utilizing keyboard navigation, as many assistive technology users
do, simply results in the presentation of a traditional
inaccessible CAPTCHA as a fall-back mechanism becoming but a mere
extra hurdle in the user's quest for access.</p>
<p>As of this writing Google has released <a href=
"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/10/introducing-reCAPTCHA-v3-new-way-to.html">
reCAPTCHA V3</a> promissing to eliminate "the need to interrupt
users with challenges at all." Obviously, this would be idea and we
believe Google has adopted several strategies recommended here
toward achieving that goal. However, as the failure fallback
remains the presentation of a CAPTCHA, it remains imperative to do
better by users who require alternative CAPTCHA options as also
enumerated here.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Federated identity systems</h3>
<p>Many large companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google
and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara
Initiative</a> have created competing “federated network identity”
systems, which can allow a user to create an account, set his or
her preferences, payment data, etc., and have that data persist
across all sites and devices that use the same service. Due to
large companies now requiring a federated identity to use
cloud-based services on their respective digital ecosystems, the
popularity of federated identities has increased significantly. As
a result, many web sites and services allow a portable form of
authentication and identification across the Web.</p>
<section>
<h4>Single sign-on</h4>
<p>Single sign-on services will need to be among the most
accessible services on the Web in order to offer equal benefits to
people with disabilities. Additionally, use of these services will
need to be ubiquitous to truly solve the problems addressed here
once and for all.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Public-key (PKI) infrastructure solutions</h4>
<p>Another approach is to use certificates for individuals who wish
to verify their identity. The certificate can be issued in such a
way as to ensure something close to a one-person-one-vote system
e.g. by issuing these certificates in person and enabling users to
develop distributed trust networks, or by having these certificates
issued from highly trusted authorities such as governments as in
<a href="https://e-resident.gov.ee/">Estonia's e-Residency
Program</a> whose certificates can be trusted not only to validate
a human user but also to provide an unimpeachable audit trail
should issues arise.</p>
<p>The cost of creating fraudulent certificates needs to be high
enough to destroy the value of producing them in most cases. Sites
would need to use mechanisms which are widely implemented in user
agents.</p>
<p>A variant of this concept, in which only people with
disabilities who are affected by other verification systems would
register, is sometimes proposed. However such approaches raise
significant privacy and stigmatisation concerns and are usually
opposed strongly by people with disabilities themselves and by
organizations that serve them. Such approaches should not be
confused with situations where people voluntarily self-identify as
individuals with disabilities. An example is the U.S. based
<a href="http://www.bookshare.org/">Bookshare</a> whose services
are only available to persons with documented print disabilities.
Bookshare provides its users access to printed materials which are
otherwise unavailable in accessible alternative formats such as
audio or Braille. An American copyright provision known as the
<a href=
"http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html"><cite>Chafee
Amendment</cite></a> [[chafee]] allows copyrighted materials to be
reproduced in specialized formats that are only usable by print
disabled users. A <a>public-key infrastructure</a> system
exemplifies an approach that would allow Bookshare’s maintainers to
ensure that the site functions in compliance with copyright
law.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Biometrics</h4>
<p>Biometric identifiers have become a popular authentication
method, especially on mobile platforms. Some physical
characteristic of the user, such as a fingerprint or a facial
profile, is first acquired and then recognized to verify the
individual’s identity. This process effectively limits the ability
of <a>web robots</a> to create a large number of false
identities.</p>
<p>However, biometric authentication mechanisms also need to be
carefully designed to avoid introducing accessibility barriers.
Individuals who lack the biological characteristics required by the
particular authentication method, e.g., fingers, or who are unable
to perform the enrollment or identification procedures are
effectively precluded from using it. This can result in denial of
access to certain users with disabilities on systems relying on
biometrics for authentication. Consequently, reliance on a single
biometric identifier to identify a user is now insufficient to
satisfy public sector procurement standards in the European Union
<a href=
"http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard/technical-requirements/biometrics">
EN 301 549, section 5.3</a> [[en-301-549]] and regulations under
section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and <a href=
"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/36/appendix-C_to_part_1194">Section
255 of the Communications Act, 36 CFR 1194, Appendix C</a>, section
403 in the United States [[36-cfr-1194]].</p>
<p>Where biometrics are used as an alternative to <a>CAPTCHA</a>,
systems should be designed to allow users to choose among multiple
and unrelated biometric identifiers. It should also be noted that
biometrics can uniquely identify individuals, making this
alternative unsuitable for applications in which it is necessary to
preserve the user’s anonymity (i.e., the application is required to
verify solely that the user is human, without obtaining identifying
information).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Multiple user devices</h3>
<p>The user of multiple devices such as a computer, smartphone,
tablet and/or wearable could provide additional support for user
authentication, as in <cite>Design, Testing and Implementation of a
New Authentication Method Using Multiple Devices</cite>
[[auth-mult]]. This could assist in addressing accessibility issues
by using <a>assistive technologies</a> on each device to confirm
the user is a human and is a specific user. The use of biometrics,
as previously discussed, could also serve as one such device
authentication mechanism.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The evolution of <a>CAPTCHA</a> techniques has demonstrated that
traditional solutions such as text-based characters contained in
images are not only challenging for people with disabilities, but
also insecure. While a majority of CAPTCHAs in use remain
challenging for people with disabilities to complete, recent
developments, including the <a href=
"https://www.google.com/reCAPTCHA">Google reCAPTCHA</a>,
multi-device authentication, and the increased prevalence of
Federated identity systems currently provide the most accessible
and flexible options in separating humans from robots.</p>
<p>However, while some CAPTCHA solutions are better than others,
there is currently no ideal solution. It is important to exercise
care that any implemented CAPTCHA technology correctly identify
people with disabilities as human.</p>
